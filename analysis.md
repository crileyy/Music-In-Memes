Questions I want to answer with database:<br>
What is the most popular language with music in memes?<br>
How many songs peak popularity date are in the same year as the meme peak popularity?<br>
How many songs have a country where its most popular that’s not the United States?<br>
How many artists have a country where they are most popular that’s not the United States?<br>
What is the most popular genre with music in memes?<br>
How many songs were released in the same year as when its meme reached peak popularity?<br>

Data column meanings:<br>
Popularity based on number of Google searches. This was found using Google Trends. The peak popularity
date is when the song or meme was searched the most during its existence. This data set assumes that all
the memes in it are popular in the United States, as I have lived in the United States my whole life, and
these are memes that I have seen.

Data collection process and experience:<br>
I wanted to analyze the different types of music being used in popular memes to see if there were any trends
or patterns, as music and memes are connected with each other in the internet age. I created a MySQL database
that stored information about popular memes that involved music from the past 15 years, the songs that were
used in the memes, and the artists of those songs. I particularly wanted to keep track of data points like
peak popularity of the meme and the song used in the meme, as well as the language of the song and country
where the song and artist are popular. I then used Tableau to create charts and graphs with my database and
have them be hosted publicly online.

Database conclusion:<br>
What is the most popular language with music in memes?<br>
English<br>
How many songs peak popularity date are in the same year as the meme peak popularity?<br>
All of them except one.<br>
How many songs are most popular in a country that’s not the United States?<br>
15<br>
How many artists have a country where they are most popular that’s not the United States?<br>
13<br>
What is the most popular genre with music in memes?<br>
Pop and electronic, but not by much. Spread across most mainstream genres like pop, electronic, R&B, hip hop, rock, etc.<br>
How many songs' peak popularity date are in the same year as their meme peak popularity and were not released within a year
of song popularity (and meme popularity since they are the same year)?<br>
12<br>

I find it interesting that a lot of the songs used in memes are songs that are popular in countries other than the United
States and made by artists who are popular in countries other than the United States. This may be because non-western songs
are more attention catching, as people from the United States are unfamiliar with their style. While a lot of the songs
used in memes are non-western, the majority of them still use English. This reveals that while foreign songs may be attention
catching, someone’s attention will most likely get lost if they cannot understand the lyrics.<br>
As seen previously with the Google Trends comparisons, memes also have a big impact on the popularity of the songs they use.
All of the music used in memes, except for one song, peaked in popularity at the same time the meme peaked in popularity.<br>
About half of the songs were released over a year before the meme they were used in reached peak popularity. Memes have the
power to bring old songs back to relevancy. A lot of youth in the United States know about the 90s band Smash Mouth just
because their song “All Star” is used in a lot of memes.<br>
It makes sense that the majority of memes use music in mainstream genres, like pop, electronic, hip hop, etc. These mainstream
genres are the most palatable to western listeners while they still have the ability to be quirky or attention grabbing.
Meanwhile, a genre like metal may be attention grabbing, but it is not palatable to the average western listener.<br>
